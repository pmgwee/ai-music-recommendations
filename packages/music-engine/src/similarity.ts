/**
 * Track similarity and playlist SEQUENCING — the piece that makes a queue feel
 * like Spotify rather than like a shuffled bag.
 *
 * BACKGROUND. Spotify's sequencing research (Moor et al., A/B tested at +2.52%
 * completed tracks / -2.73% skips) shows two effects dominate:
 *   · position-aware — the FIRST track decides whether a session starts at all,
 *     so it should be something the listener already trusts;
 *   · local-sequential — a listener skips a track when it jumps too far from the
 *     one before it. Adjacent tracks must be close in taste-space.
 *
 * Spotify measures "close" with audio features (energy, tempo, valence). We
 * can't: Spotify removed that API in Nov 2024 and YouTube Music never exposed
 * it. So we need a different distance.
 *
 * WHAT WE MEASURED. The obvious substitute — trusting YouTube's own radio order
 * — does not work. Against youtubei.js 17.2.0:
 *
 *     correlation(radio rank, similarity to seed) = -0.145   (≈ none)
 *     adjacent same-primary-artist in native order = 1/49 (2%)
 *     native-order path cost 4084  vs  random shuffle 2653   (worse than random)
 *
 * YouTube's radio queue is a DIVERSITY-CALIBRATED slate, not a smooth path — the
 * same job Spotify's KL-calibration does. Useful, but it is not a distance
 * ordering and must not be treated as one.
 *
 * WHAT DOES WORK. Two tracks that keep turning up in the SAME radio queues are
 * behaviourally close — that is precisely the co-listening signal Spotify's own
 * track embeddings are trained on ("close = likely listened to successively").
 * Measured overlap between radio neighbourhoods spread 0.11–0.54, i.e. it
 * discriminates. So each candidate becomes a sparse vector over the sources it
 * appeared in, and similarity is the cosine between those vectors.
 *
 * The vectors are free: we already fetch those queues for candidate generation.
 *
 * ── DO NOT ADD TIME DECAY HERE ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It is tempting to age-weight this graph so it "follows taste changes". Don't.
 * Koren's temporal-dynamics work (the Netflix Prize solution) tested exactly
 * that and found quality improved as decay was moderated, and was best with no
 * decay at all — underweighting old actions loses signal along with the noise,
 * which bites hardest when data per user is scarce (which is our situation).
 * His reconciliation: two items are related if users treated them similarly in
 * a short window, "even if this happened long ago".
 *
 * So the layers are split deliberately:
 *   · THIS FILE — how tracks relate to each other      → never decays
 *   · ranking.ts — what the listener wants right now   → decays (recency term)
 * Taste change is tracked by which seeds get chosen and how candidates are
 * ranked, not by corroding the relationship graph.
