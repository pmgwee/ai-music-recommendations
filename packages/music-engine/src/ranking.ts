 * weighting: an explicit save outranks a completed play, a completed play
 * outranks a start, and a skip inside the first 30 seconds is the strongest

 * Confidence weighting, after Hu, Koren & Volinsky (2008), "Collaborative

 *
 *   preference  p = 1 if the listener engaged at all   (binary)
 *   confidence  c = 1 + α·r                            (how sure we are)
 *
 * This is why a like is not modelled as "a bigger positive". Once a track has
 * been played, preference is already 1 — a like cannot raise it. What a like
 * does is collapse the ambiguity: a play can mean "I left it on", whereas a like
 * can only mean "yes". So it dominates the confidence term instead.
 *
 * Skips enter as NEGATIVE evidence rather than as absence. The reference
 * implementation of this paper (benfred/implicit) does the same thing — it
 * accepts negative confidence values to express "the user disliked this" — which
 * is exactly what a sub-30-second abandon tells us.
